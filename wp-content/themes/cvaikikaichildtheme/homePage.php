    <p><b>Section one:</b><br> Aikido is a Japanese martial art where training is used as a way for personal development, self-discipline and spiritual growth. The ideal in Aikido is not to think of defeating attackers, but rather to be in harmony with them while neutralizing their attacks. The nature of Aikido philosophy is to promote harmony and non-conflict:  there is no "sparring" during practice. Rather, training partners help each other learn the proper execution of various forms.
